  Hello! I'm Matt, a wedding and engagement photographer based in the San Francisco Bay Area, California. As your photographer, my goal is quite simply to document your wedding through a powerful combination of <strong>simple and elegant</strong> imagery that brings you right into the scene. <a class="read-more">(Read more...)</a></p>

<article class="wedding-blurb">
  <p>My style focuses on capturing the elements of joy, serendipity, and humor. With two years of experience as a studio portrait photographer, I'm keenly aware of how people want to be seen and what angles work best. I bring my knowledge about shooting in natural, artificial and hybrid lighting conditions, which means I can provide technical solutions for any venue of your choosing.</p>

  <p>On the creative side, I love the grainy, saturated look of film. Yet digital cameras have come a long way in terms of reliability, portability, and speed. With this in mind, I shoot digital and post-process the final images to have the timeless look of film.</p>

  <p>I became a wedding photographer quite unexpectedly. I've been enamored by photography since I was a child, but the partnership between photographer and married couple is uniquely intimate and something that I deeply value and cherish. It is my ultimate privilege to be with you on your important day and document your story through timeless images.</p>
