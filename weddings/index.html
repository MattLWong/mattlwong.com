  Hello! I'm Matt, a wedding and engagement photographer based in the San Francisco Bay Area, California. As your photographer, my goal is quite simply to document your wedding through a powerful combination of <strong>simple and elegant</strong> imagery that brings you right into the scene.</p>

<p>My style focuses on capturing elements of joy, serendipity, and humor. With two years of experience as a studio portrait photographer, I'm keenly aware of how people want to be seen and what angles work best. I bring my knowledge about shooting in natural, artificial and hybrid lighting condition, which means I can provide technical solutions for any venue of your choosing.</p>

<p>On the creative side, I love the grainy, saturated look of film. Yet digital cameras have come a long way in terms of reliability, portability, and speed. With this in mind, I shoot digital and post-process the final images to have the timeless look of film.</p>

<p>I became a wedding photographer quite unexpectedly. I've been enamoured by photography since I was very young, but the close partnership between the photographer and married couple is uniquely intimate and something that I have come to deeply value. It is my ultimate privilege and pleasure to be with you on your important day and document your story through timeless, powerful images.
