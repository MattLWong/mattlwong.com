      Hello! I'm Matt, a wedding and engagement photographer based in the San Francisco Bay Area. I'm passionate about photography that tells a story through <em><strong>simple and elegant</strong></em> imagery. My style is focused on capturing both elements of humor and beauty in moments of celebration. Weddings are a culmination of joy, and it is my wonderful privilege to document your important day for years to come.
