      Hello! I'm Matt, a wedding and engagement photographer based in the San Francisco Bay Area. I'm passionate about photography that tells a story through <em><strong>simple and elegant</strong></em> imagery. My style is focused on capturing elements of both humor and joy in moments of celebration. Coming from a portrait photography background, I am especially aware about how people want to be seen and what angles work best. I bring a wealth of experience shooting under natural and artifical lighting to provide technical solutions for any venue of your choosing.</p>

    <p>On the creative side, I love the grainy, saturated look of film. Digital cameras have come a long way in terms of realiable and speed. With this in mind, I shoot digital and post-process the images to have the timeless quality of film.</p>

    <p>That said, my attraction to wedding photography is the special relationship with the to-be-married couple. Photography, to me, has always been about cultivating a relationship. Ultimately, it is my privilege to be with you throughout the day and tell your love story with beautiful images.</p>
