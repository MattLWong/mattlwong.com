I received an urgent email this morning at 9am from a wedding photographer, asking me to cover him as a second shooter this evening as he suffered a sudden injury and couldn't make it. It came out of the blue, and without too much thinking, I told him I could make it. I packed my gear and left the house wearing a white collared shirt.

We first made contact several months ago, as I had emailed many photographers in the area asking if they needed a second shooter. I guess this is how you find work as a wedding photographer.

The last wedding I shot was in August, so I figured this would be a nice refresher. I really wish I would have known the bride and groom at least a day or two before the shoot; that would have really helped with communication. Being that close to the married couple is difficult unless you already have a line of communication.

I managed to get most of the shot with a 24-70mm, including the portraits of the groom and groomsmen, which I think turned out well. The lighting inside the church was difficult, given two contrasting colors of light sources. As usual, I really had to stand in the way to get the right angles. The other photographer I worked with, Sarah, mentioned at one point that she preferred taking candids than giving direction. The hardest part about the whole thing was getting the family photos out of the way. I noticed Sarah used the small white plastic card as a bounce in his flash, and the results look pretty good. All in all, a good experience with some technical challenges thrown in the way.
