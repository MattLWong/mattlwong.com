I had a wonderful chance to meet and photograph a group of STEM graduate students and postdocs at Sutardja Dai Hall, UC Berkeley. The lead organizer, Amal, organized the event, and around 22 people showed up ready to be photographed.

The photographs were fine. I used a two strobe set-up, the key light set at 1/1 FP and the fill at around 1/16. Some of the students were tall, so I had to get on a chair and squat to take their pictures.

I sent my recommendations to Amal the next day.

Looking at the pictures, I can start to see areas of improvement. I really would like to avoid illuminating the neck and overexposing the left torso so much â€” is there a way to avoid that? I also think Photoshop would be appropriate to edit the brightness of the skin where the flash is strongest.

Photoshop, I think, is the next major step for me as a photographer. I also would like to start to experiment with the Butterfly lighting technique, although I think that requires some additional investment.
