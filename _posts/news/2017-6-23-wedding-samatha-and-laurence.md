Arrived at 2:30pm. As third shooter, I helped the second shooter with the groom's getting ready stages, and took candids during the wedding ceremony and reception. The theme was a mixture of Western and Middle-Eastern cultures. Approximately 100 guests. I mounted the flash on my camera and took pictures of the dancing. The results were mixed. The lead photographer mounted two flashes on tripods and wirelessly synced them, set at FP 1/32, pointed down. The final shots of the couple walking down an aisle while guests were holding sparklers was spectacular. Left at 11pm.
