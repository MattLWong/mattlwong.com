summary: Arrived at 2:30pm. As the third shooter, I helped the second shooter with the groom's getting-ready, and took candids during the wedding ceremony and reception. The bride and groom were from Western and Persian cultures, which made for an interesting selection of music and themes. There were approximately 100 guests. At one point during the dancing I mounted the flash on my camera and the results were mixed. The primary photographer mounted two flashes on tripods and wirelessly synced them, set at manually at FP 1/32, pointing them down. The final shots of the couple walking down an aisle while guests were holding sparklers was beautiful; the bride and groom were quite satisfied. We left at 11pm.
