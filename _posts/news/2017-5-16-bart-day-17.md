summary: Arrived and set up at 1845, and by 1955 the BART patrol officer shooed me off the premises. 13 sitters, all shot at f/11 1/125 ISO 160. I photographed one person before, and although I didn't remember her name, she was interested in having another picture taken (not sure if she got back to me the first time).
