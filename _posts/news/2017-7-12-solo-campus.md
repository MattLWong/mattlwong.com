A few weeks ago a social entrepreneur reached out to me to have his portrait taken. He works at UC Berkeley, so I decided it would be best to meet on the steps of the Haas Business School. From 7-8pm, we did a short tour of campus, walking from the business school and ending at the Campanile. I proceeded to take a total of approximately 400 pictures. As usual, I tried to engage him with conversation, to bring out his character, to make him feel good, and to deflect any possible feelings of self-consciousness. I wanted to make him feel as comfortable as possible in front of the camera. After thirty minutes, he adjusted to being photographed. This is how I like to do my portraits -- it's how I've done it for several years -- there's no way around it, at least for now. Direction really isn't my thing, although I'd like to study it one day.

Since I'm shooting digital, I'm not worried about taking too many pictures. In fact, I take so many not because I think they will all be useful, but because I primarily want to desensitize the person. I want the person to hear the shutter and think, "This is normal, I'm not actually being photographed now." As they're speaking, I'm snapping away to make them feel like they're doing the right thing. "You're doing great, now tell me more about your time in Stockholm..."

For one hour of photography, I charged the full price of an outdoor shoot.

At one point, I told him, maybe a little inadvertently, that I was worried none of the pictures wouldn't turn out well. He said he found me and picked me from out of all the photographers. He had faith in me. I was still a bit anxious that I didn't get *the* shot. I think ultimately the purpose of the shoot is to get just one photo that works. You can throw the rest away. Just get the shot.
