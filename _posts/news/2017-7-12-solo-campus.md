A few weeks ago a young social entrepreneur reached out to me to have his official portrait taken. Since he works at UC Berkeley, I decided it would be appropriate to meet on the steps of the Haas Business School. From 7 to 8pm, we made a short tour of campus, walking from the business school and ending at the Campanile. I proceeded to take a total of approximately 400 pictures.

As usual, I tried to engage him with conversation, to bring out his character, to make him feel good, and to deflect any possible feelings of self-consciousness. My goal was to make him feel as comfortable as possible in front of the camera. I noticed he tried to smile in each of the pictures, and I thought it would do some good if he didn't try as hard.

Since I'm shooting digital, I'm not worried about taking too many pictures. In fact, I take them in rapid succession not because I think they will all be useful, but because I want to desensitize the person to being photographed. I want the person to hear the shutter and think, "This is normal, I'm not actually being photographed, I'm not afraid of the camera." As they're speaking, I'm snapping away to make them feel like they're doing the right thing. "You're doing great, now tell me more about your time in Stockholm..."

At one point, I told him, maybe inadvertently, that I was worried none of the pictures would turn out well. He said he found me and picked me from out of all the photographers and he had faith in me. I was still a bit anxious that I didn't get *the* shot. The purpose of the shoot is ultimately to get just one or two photos that work for a particular purpose. You can throw the rest away. Just get the shot.
