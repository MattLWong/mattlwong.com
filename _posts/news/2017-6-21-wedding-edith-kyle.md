Second shooter for a ~25 person wedding in the rolling hills of Carmel, CA. The setting was warm and ideal: the couple, from France, was casual but impeccably dressed â€”- the men wore violet bow ties, the bridesmaids in dresses of varying shades of pink and purple. I observed the main photographer directing the bride and groom in different poses. We had an prepared meal of salmon and steak and left a bit shy of 10pm after we got some photos of the first dance.
