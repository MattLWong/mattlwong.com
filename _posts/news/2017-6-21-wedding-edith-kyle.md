Second shooter for a ~25 person wedding in the hills of Carmel, CA. The setting was warm and ideal: the couple, from France, dressed casually but looked great â€”- the men wore violet bow ties, the bridesmaids in dresses of varying shades of pink and mauve purple. I observed the main photographer directing the bride and groom in different poses during the portrait session, which I thought was kind of weird. We had an prepared meal of salmon and steak and left a bit shy of 10pm after getting some photos of the first dance.
