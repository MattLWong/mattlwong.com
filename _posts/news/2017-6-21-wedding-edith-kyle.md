summary: Second shooter for a 25 person wedding in the hills of Carmel, CA. The setting was warm and idyllic. The couple, from France, dressed casually but looked great the men wore purple bow ties, the bridesmaids in dresses of varying shades of pink and mauve purple. I observed the main photographer directing the bride and groom in different poses during the portrait session. We had an prepared meal of salmon and steak and left a bit shy of 10pm after getting some photos of the first dance.
