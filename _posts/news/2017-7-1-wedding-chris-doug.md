I'm particularly proud this was the first wedding I shot **completely by myself**, and everything went out quite smoothly. I arrived at the wine tasting room at 10am, promptly Doug put me to work. In total I captured 1318 images - I was aiming for around 500! We went wine tasting afterword, and they offered me food and wine. I really enjoyed this experience, especially working closely with the married couple. At the end of the day I managed to get around 947 images for the clients to see and proof.
