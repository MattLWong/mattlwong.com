Arrived at 8pm, set up 53" white seamless paper, 12 sitters, mostly shot at 50mm at f/11, 1/125 ISO 160 FP 1-2.6. Flash power really depends on sitter's skin tones. The Warrios v Caveliers game 4 championship took place during this same period, hence the rather low turn-out. I managed to squeeze in a few shots in with the Mamiya 7 rangefinder, but had difficulty pushing the radio transceiver into the hot shoe mount. Would like to upgrade to pocket wizards.
