summary: Arrived at 8pm, set up 53" white seamless paper, shot 12 sitters, 50mm at f/11, 1/125 ISO 160 FP 1-2.6. Flash power really depends subtly on sitter's skin tone. The Warriors v Cavaliers game 4 championship took place during this same period, hence the low turn-out. I managed to squeeze in a few shots in with the Mamiya 7 rangefinder, but had difficulty pushing the radio transceiver into the hot shoe mount. Would eventually like to upgrade to pocket wizards.
