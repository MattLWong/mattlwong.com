Third shooter for a ~50 person wedding in Lafayette, CA. In the hotel lobby I saw a group of men and women dressed up for a wedding, I took a few pictures of them, but after a while I saw their photographer and realized they weren't the group I was supposed to follow! The ceremony was held at Hacienda De Las Flores. There was a tradition ceremony and I paid close attention to where the main photographers were standing. Left at around 7:30pm.
