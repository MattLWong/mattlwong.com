I was the third shooter for a ~50-75 person wedding in Lafayette, CA. In the hotel lobby I saw a group of men and women dressed up for a wedding. After I took a few pictures of them, I saw their photographer and realized they weren't the group I was supposed to follow!

The ceremony was held at Hacienda De Las Flores in Moraga CA. There was a tradition ceremony and I paid close attention to where the main photographers were standing. The main photographer preferred that I didn't take very many pictures since the couple were sensitive about images being leaked. We left at around 7:30pm.

What I learned: placement, placement, placement. Be in the right place, and the pictures will be fine. I also got a chance to observe the main photographer coordinating movement with his second.
