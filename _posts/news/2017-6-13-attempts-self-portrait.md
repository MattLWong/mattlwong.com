Earlier today I made several attempts to get portrait of myself. Throughout the history of photographer, photographers have always been fascinated about capturing themselves. I had to manually calibrate the focus after each shot, recalibrating slowly if I went too short or too long. (Fortunately digital photography is more forgiving.) I used the 50mm lens at f/5.6, which is more forgiving in depth-of-field and framing than the 85mm.  I had around six or seven seconds to get in position after I pressed the shutter release, which meant I had to pose rather quickly.

My favorite pictures are the ones where Iâ€™m not looking directly at the camera. So much of portrait photography is about getting the sitter to act out an emotion for the camera.
