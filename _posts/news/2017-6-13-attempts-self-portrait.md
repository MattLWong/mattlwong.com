I made several attempts to get a professional self-portrait tonight. Most photographers are pretty deliberate when it comes to their self-image, and many take their own pictures throughout their careers. It wasn't easy; I had to manually calibrate the focus after each shot, recalibrating if I went too short or too long. Then I had to pose. I used the 50mm lens at f/5.6, which is more forgiving in depth of field than the 85mm.  I had around six or seven seconds between the moment I pressed the shutter release and when the shutter went off.

My favorite pictures are the ones where Iâ€™m not looking directly at the camera. They appear contemplative, but of course there was no time but to pretend. So much of portrait photography is about getting the sitter to act an emotion for the camera, giving them that special freedom to roam through old emotions.
