summary: Earlier today I made several attempts to get portrait of myself. Most photographers at some point photograph themselves (as do most people with smartphones), but setting up the camera and posing wasn't so easy; I had to manually calibrate the focus after each shot, recalibrating slowly if I went too short or too long. (Fortunately digital photography is more forgiving.) I used the 50mm lens at f/5.6, which is more forgiving in depth-of-field and framing than the 85mm.  I had around six or seven seconds to get in position after I pressed the shutter release, which meant I had to pose rather quickly. My favorite pictures are the ones where I’m not looking directly at the camera. They appear contemplative, but of course there wasn't time but to pretend. So much of portrait photography is about getting the sitter to act an emotion for the camera, giving them that special freedom to roam through old emotions.
