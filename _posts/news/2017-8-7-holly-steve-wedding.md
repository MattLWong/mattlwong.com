There are moments that a wedding photographer can't miss: the ring exchange, the walkaway, the first dance. But there are also moments that an experienced photographer picks up on — the interactions between guests and married couple, the family bearing witness to the exchange of dynamics, the spontaneous joy on the dance floor. These moments last fractions of a second, but they're just as symbolic of the wedding as the formal events, and maybe even more revealing. If the purpose of a wedding photographer is to document, then it's the photographer's job to observe the entire proceedings from the best angle and artfully gauge what should be remembered.

This was the first full wedding I photographed by myself, and I have to say that I loved most of it. The biggest question I had was, "Which lens should I use for this moment?" I found the 24-70 to be the most useful for the ceremony and formal portraits, and, of course, the 50mm f/1.8 is a great portrait lens for couples.

There is excitement and thrill, perhaps along with a vague anxiety that I wasn't doing my job well enough. We photographers want to capture everything and do it flawlessly.

At the same time, it probably isn't a wise strategy to remember everything. We must omit some facts to tell a narrative cohesively and concisely. The process of omitting is just as important a feature of the art as the process of recording. In other words: There are so many pictures to choose from.

Sometimes I think the best pictures are in some sense abstract. They don't reveal everything in pixel-perfect density, but they do something to the viewer. An emotional picture captures what is necessary to convey that feeling, whether it's through contradiction, composition, or color.

The strangest part about being a wedding photographer is being around people who have known each other for decades, but may not have seen each other in years. This moment presents as a critical junction that doesn't come very often in their lives. At the same time, the wedding photographer is among the closest (in proximity) to the bride and groom, which makes him also (temporarily) a part of the family. At one point today, one of the family members pulled me aside and said, *"You should hand your camera to somebody and ask him to take pictures of you."* I asked why, and he said, in basic terms, that I was also a guest of the event, and that I was supposed to be in the pictures! I had felt all along that I was just a spectator to the event, but the way he said it made it seem like I was also a participant in relation to the family.

Pictures are a defining aspect of weddings. A mother told her daughter, who was tired of posing, that "the purpose of weddings is to be in pictures." The pictures are the facade that symbolizes the relationships of people, and the wedding is the formal unification of two distinct families. The photographs furnish indisputable proof of this. Although the wedding photographer doesn't personally know these people, he or she feels the weight in meaning of the pictures.

Wedding photography is hard because you're supposed to produce art out of a moving train. Things moves quickly, and you try to find something extraordinary in the ordinary. In the end, it's the photos are remind us of the past better than anything else. I suppose that helps to explain why we care so much about photography in the first place.
