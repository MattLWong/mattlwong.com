Arrived at 16th St. in the Mission District at 18:30. I tried setting up near the escalators but the wind draft nearly carried away the backdrop, and plus it was a bit obtrusive to pedestrian traffic. After some deliberation I decided to set up in a small corner within the station premises, near the staircase running down to the trains. I taped the white seamless paper to the ground. I used two flashes, one to light the backdrop and the other as a key light. The effect was a slight gradient from high to low going from bottom to the top of the frame. I would have preferred to have a third flash that lit the top of the seamless paper to avoid this gradient. In total I photographed 24 people, mostly who were in their twenties but also a Hispanic family with four children. They were especially grateful of the opportunity to be photographed.
