Arrived at 16th St. in the Mission District at 18:30. I tried setting up near the escalators but the draft nearly carried away the backdrop. After some deliberation I settled on setting up in a small corner within the station near the staircase running down to the trains. I taped the white seamless paper to the ground. I used two flashes, one to light the backdrop and the other as a main light. The effect was a slight gradient from high to low going from bottom to the top of the frame. I photographed 24 people, mostly in their twenties but also a Latino family with four children.
