          My primary interest is photographing human subjects. It is satisfying to photograph people because the work has practical benefits—people always need images that best represent themselves—and artistic merits. There is nothing in the visual spectrum that we respond to more viscerally to than the face and body in its myraid forms. I am fascinated by how our physical appearances are intimately intertwined with identity and beliefs about personality.

          As a classical and jazz pianist myself, I am both fascinated and bewildered by modern music. I would like to invite composers to my studio to get a better sense of where modern composition is heading, and how to relate these changes with the public at large.

          I'm interested in meeting and photographing janitors and custodians living and working in the San Francisco Bay Area. As a barista at a local coffee shop, I'm fascinated by the work and would like to explore themes of cleanliness, routine, and work.

          Traffic death have seen a sharp and sudden increase in the past two years, reversing a decreasing trend in traffic fatalities, hinting at the possibility that we are increasingly distracted on the road. In an effort to bring to light these changes, I would like to collaborate with a driving safety institute on an project that depicts the situation of drivers glued to their phones while on the road.

          <br>
          Fall 2016 (Completed)
          <br>
          While visiting NYC in September of 2016 I encountered many seemingly abandoned bicycles, many missing important parts. So I collected a series of images of these dilapidated machines while walking through Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the Bronx. It seems as if the bikes were all but abandoned by their owners, maybe because they were no longer useful. They now serve as decorative pieces (and occupy valuable spots to park actual working bicycles!).
