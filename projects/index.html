<p>
  I'm interested in meeting and photographing people. My projects are often centered around a contemporary subject matter that I find interesting and worth telling. Portraits are practical — people always need images that represent themselves — but they also require finesse and technical dexterity. Portrait photography in particular acquaints the viewer with a wider range of people, which can expand his or her beliefs and prejudices. I am fascinated by how our physical appearances such as fashion, body art, and expression contribute toward qualities like personal identity and persona, and I hope to explore this in my work. </p>
  <p>My photographic influences include <a class="make-me-grey" href="//www.greenfield-sanders.com">Timothy Greenfield-Sanders</a>, Annie Leibovitz, and <a class="make-me-grey" href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/richard-avedon">Richard Avedon</a>.

<h3>CURRENT</h3>
<p>
  <a class="make-me-grey" href="#"><strong>Portraits of Living Composers</strong></a>
  <br>
  2017—2021 (Active)
  <br>
  Like many classically-trained musicians, I'm fascinated, intrigued and sometimes bewildered by music produced in the 20th and 21st centuries, by composers like Messiaen, Schoenberg, and Ligeti. I would like to invite composers and musicologists to my studio to improve my understanding of this period.

  <em>Photographs will be taken on a 4x5" large-format view camera with Ilford FP4 black-and-white negative film.</em>

  <a class="make-me-grey" href="#"><strong>Ruraltopia</strong></a>
  <br>
  Fall 2017 (Active)
  <br>
  The rural counties north of San Francisco and Sacramento (Modoc, Lassen, Siskiyou) voted overwhelmingly Republican in the 2016 US presidential election. I'm interested in visiting these areas and bringing back a view of rural California that we may not be familiar with.

  <a class="make-me-grey" href="#"><strong>The Face of BART</strong></a>
  <br>
  Spring-Fall 2017 (Active)
  <br>
  The BART station is an ideal place to encounter a diverse range of people of various ages, occupations, and socioeconomic backgrounds. I utilize the public space near BART stations, adapting to ambient lighting conditions, to challenge to my ability to work in different constraints. I hope to produce an amalgamation of BART passengers, all photographed in the same manner as a means of democratizing identity.

<h3>Past Projects</h3>

<p>
  <a class="make-me-grey" href="{{site.baseurl}}/projects/bikes-nyc"><strong>Bikes of NYC</strong></a>
  <br>
  Fall 2016 (<em>Complete</em>)
  <br>
  While visiting NYC in September of 2016 I encountered many abandoned bicycles, some missing vital parts like wheels or handlebars. So I went around collecting a series of images of these derelict machines, through Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Harlem. The bikes now serve mainly as decorative pieces in the city, and they also occupy valuable parking spots for actual working bicycles!
