<p>
  I'm mainly interested in photographing people. My projects are often organized around a larger thematic and contemporary subject matter that I find interesting and worth telling. Portraits are inherently practical — people always need images that represent themselves — but also require finesse and some degree of technical dexterity. Portrait photography in particular acquaints the viewer with a wider range of people, which can expand his beliefs, prejudices, and knowledge. I am fascinated by how our appearances contribute to human qualities, like personal identity and charisma. Plus, I almost without exception enjoy meeting all kinds of people.</p>
  <p>My photographic influences include <a class="make-me-grey" href="//www.greenfield-sanders.com">Timothy Greenfield-Sanders</a>, Annie Leibovitz, and <a class="make-me-grey" href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/richard-avedon">Richard Avedon</a>.

<h3>CURRENT</h3>
<p>
  <a class="make-me-grey" href="#"><strong>Portraits of Living Composers</strong></a>
  <br>
  2017—2021 (Active)
  <br>
  Like many classical musicians, I'm fascinated, intrigued and sometimes bewildered by serious music produced in the 20th and 21st centuries, by composers like Messiaen, Schoenberg, and Ligeti. I would like to invite composers and musicologists to my studio to improve my understanding of this period. Ultimately I would like to produce a kind of anthology, both pictoral and in writing, based on these experiences.

  <a class="make-me-grey" href="#"><strong>The Distracted Driver Series</strong></a>
  <br>
  Summer 2017 (Active)
  <br>
  Traffic fatalies have seen a sharp and sudden increase in the past two years, reversing a trend in traffic safety and hinting at the possibility that we are increasingly distracted by our devices on the road. Photography can be seen as a mean of addressing these systemic safety issues.

  <a class="make-me-grey" href="#"><strong>The Face of BART</strong></a>
  <br>
  Spring—Summer 2017 (Active)
  <br>
  The BART station is an ideal location to meet a diverse range of people of all ages and from various socioeconomic backgrounds. I utilize the public space near BART stations to adapt to different lighting conditions, a challenge to my ability to work in different constraints. I hope to produce an amalgamation of people of various backgrounds, all photographed in the same manner as a means of democratizing identity. I also use this as an opportunity to develop techniques in portrait photography.

<h3>Past Projects</h3>

<p>
  <a class="make-me-grey" href="{{site.baseurl}}/projects/bikes-nyc"><strong>Bikes of NYC</strong></a>
  <br>
  Fall 2016 (<em>Complete</em>)
  <br>
  While visiting NYC in September of 2016 I encountered many abandoned bicycles, some missing vital parts like wheels or handlebars. So I went around collecting a series of images of these derelict machines, through Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Harlem. The bikes now serve mainly as decorative pieces in the city, and they also occupy valuable parking spots for actual working bicycles!
