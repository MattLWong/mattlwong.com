  I'm interested in meeting and photographing people. My projects are often organized around and within the context of a larger thematic and contemporary subject matter. To me, portraits are essential because of their practical benefits — people always need images that represent themselves — and artistic merits. Portrait photography also provides the opportunity for the photographer to become acquainted with a wider range of people and to expand his or her beliefs, biases, and knowledge. I am fascinated by the history and sociocultural aspects of iconography and how our appearances contribute to personal identity. My primary photographic influences include <a href="//www.greenfield-sanders.com">Timothy Greenfield-Sanders</a>, Annie Leibovitz, and <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/richard-avedon">Richard Avedon</a>.

  <a href="#"><strong>Portraits of Living Composers</strong></a>
  <br>
  2017—2020 (Active)
  <br>
  Like many classical musicians, I'm fascinated and intrigued and sometimes bewildered by serious music produced in the 20th and 21st centuries, by composers like Messiaen, Schoenberg, and Ligeti. I would like to invite composers and musicologists of all varieties to my studio for a conversation. Ultimately I would like to contribute an anthology, both pictoral and written, built on these experiences.

  <a href="#"><strong>The Distracted Driver Series</strong></a>
  <br>
  Summer 2017 (Active)
  <br>
  Traffic fatalies have seen a sharp and sudden increase in the past two years, reversing a trend in traffic safety and hinting at the possibility that we are increasingly distracted by our devices on the road. Photography can be seen as a mean of addressing these systemic safety issues.

  <a href="#"><strong>The Face of BART</strong></a>
  <br>
  Spring—Summer 2017 (Active)
  <br>
  The BART station is an ideal location to meet a diverse range of people of all ages and from various socioeconomic backgrounds. I utilize the public space near BART stations to adapt to different lighting conditions, a challenge to my ability to work in different constraints. I hope to produce an amalgamation of people of various backgrounds, all photographed in the same manner as a means of democratizing identity. I also use this as an opportunity to develop techniques in portrait photography.

  <br>
  Fall 2016 (<em>Complete</em>)
  <br>
  While visiting NYC in September 2016 I encountered many ostensibly abandoned bicycles, some missing key parts like wheels or the handlebar. So I collected a series of images of these dilapidated machines while walking through downtown Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Harlem. The bikes now serve as decorative pieces in the city (and occupy valuable parking spots for actual working bicycles!).
