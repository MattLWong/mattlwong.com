      I'm interested in photographing human subjects, often in the context of a larger thematic and relevant contemporary subject matter. For me, portrait photography provides a satisfying creative outlet because of its practical benefits — people need images that represent themselves — and artistic merits. Portrait photography also offers the opportunity to become acquainted with different peoples and a way to expand my beliefs, prejudices, and knowledge. I am fascinated by the history and sociocultural aspects of portraits and how our appearances are intertwined with personal identity and personality. My main photographic influences include <a href="www.greenfield-sanders.com">Timothy Greenfield-Sanders</a>, Annie Leibovitz, and <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/richard-avedon">Richard Avedon</a>.

      As an amateur classical and jazz pianist, I'm fascinated and bewildered by music produced in the 20th and 21st centuries. I would like to invite composers to my studio for a conversation about where music is headed in the early 21st century.

      <br>
      Traffic fatalies have seen a sharp and sudden increase in the past two years, reversing a trend in traffic safety and hinting at the possibility that we are increasingly distracted by our devices on the road. Photography can be seen as a mean of addressing these systemic safety issues.

      <br>
      Spring—Summer 2017 (Active)
      <br>
      The BART station is an ideal location to meet a diverse range of people of all ages and backgrounds. I utilize the public space near BART stations to adapt to different lighting conditions. I hope to produce an amalgamation of people of various backgrounds, all photographed in the same manner. I also use this as an opportunity to develop techniques in portrait photography.

      <br>
      Fall 2016 (<em>Complete</em>)
      <br>
      While visiting NYC in September 2016 I encountered many ostensibly abandoned bicycles, some missing key parts like wheels or the handlebar. So I collected a series of images of these dilapidated machines while walking through downtown Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Harlem. The bikes now serve as decorative pieces in the city (and occupy valuable parking spots for actual working bicycles!).
